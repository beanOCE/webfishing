  bean's webfishing mod collection!
</h1>
<br>

<p>A collection of mods for WEBFISHING made in C#/GDScirpt! Mods that require Sulayre's Lure API or any external API's will be marked with an asterisk! (*)
This is purely a hobby and none of these will be too insane, just simple cosmetic and chat QoL mods! (may change in future ;p )</p>
