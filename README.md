  bean's webfishing mod collection!
</h1>
<br>

<p>A collection of mods for WEBFISHING made in C#/GDScript! Mods that require Sulayre's Lure API or any external API's will be marked with an asterisk! (*)
This is purely a hobby and none of these will be too insane, just simple cosmetic and chat QoL mods! (may change in future ;p )</p>
<br>

## Pronouns!*
#### A WEBFISHING mod to add pronouns to in-game titles! Includes neo-pronouns and mixed pronouns!

This mod is still a work in progress, but hope to release as a 3rd-party mod soon! **Requires [Lure ðŸ¦ž](https://github.com/Sulayre/WebfishingLure).**
